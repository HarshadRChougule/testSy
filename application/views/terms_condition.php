						<p	class="text-justify	">Bowling eXpress LLC. and its subsidiaries and affiliates (“Bowling eXpress Pay,” “Express Lanes,” “Get A Pair,”  or “Book A Pair”) own and operate certain websites, certain technology platforms, and certain other related online and mobile services (including, without limitation, our Mobile Applications, as defined below) that reference or will reference these Terms of Use (collectively, the “Sites”). These Terms of Use (the “Agreement”) constitute a contract between you and us that governs your access and use of the Sites and Apps. What does that mean? It means that by accessing and/or using the Sites or our services through the Sites, or by clicking a button or checking a box marked “I Agree” (or something similar), you agree to all the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If you do not agree, do not use the Sites. As used in this Agreement, “you” means any visitor, user, or other person who accesses our Sites, whether or not such person registered for an Account (as defined below). Unless otherwise agreed by Bowling eXpress LLC in a separate written agreement with you or your authorized representative, the Sites are made available solely for your personal, non-commercial use.</p>

						<p	class="text-justify">	IMPORTANT: PLEASE REVIEW THE “DISPUTE RESOLUTION” SECTION SET FORTH BELOW CAREFULLY, AS IT WILL REQUIRE YOU TO RESOLVE ALL DISPUTES WITH Bowling eXpress LLC THROUGH BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU AND BOWLING EXPRESS LLC ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY. YOU FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING AGAINST Bowling eXpress LLC. BY ENTERING THIS AGREEMENT, YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY, ALL OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND HAVE TAKEN TIME TO CONSIDER THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS IMPORTANT DECISION.</p>

						<p	class="text-justify"><b>USING OUR SERVICE</b></p>

						<p	class="text-justify">You may only create and hold one account on each Site for your personal use (an “Account”). You may have another account if you are using the Site as part of a corporate account created for business purposes pursuant to a separate agreement with Bowling eXpress LLC. In consideration of the use of the Sites and the services contained therein, you agree that you are able to create a binding legal obligation with Bowling eXpress LLC, and you also agree to: (a) provide true, accurate, current, and complete information about yourself, and (b) maintain and promptly update the personal information you provide to keep it true, accurate, current, and complete.</p>

						<p	class="text-justify">The Sites may permit you to make purchases without an Account or without logging in to your Account. If you make a purchase in this manner, we may create an Account for you based on the information provide to us in connection with the transaction (e.g., your name, phone number, email address, and other transaction information). If you are a minor in the jurisdiction in which you reside (generally under the age of 18), you must have the permission of, and be directly supervised by, your parent or legal guardian to use the Sites, and your parent or legal guardian must read and agree to this Agreement prior to your using the Sites. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you are not authorized to use the Sites if you are under the age of 13. If you are using the Sites on behalf of an entity, organization, or company, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that organization to this Agreement and you agree to be bound by this Agreement on behalf of that organization.</p>

						<p	class="text-justify">If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, including, without limitation, having an invalid or expired payment method on file, or if Bowling eXpress LLC has reasonable grounds to suspect that any information you provide is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, Bowling eXpress LLC has the right to block your current or future use of the Sites (or any portion thereof) and/or terminate this Agreement with you. If your Account is cancelled for any or no reason, you may forfeit any pending, current, or future account credits or promotional offers and any other forms of unredeemed value in or associated with your Account without prior notice to you.</p>

						<p	class="text-justify">You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your Account including your password and, if applicable, any password for Facebook, Google, or other third party login. You are also responsible for all activities or any other actions that occur under or that are taken in connection with your Account. You agree to: (a) immediately notify Bowling eXpress LLC of any known or suspected unauthorized use(s) of your password or Account, or any known or suspected breach of security, including, without limitation, loss, theft, or unauthorized disclosure of your password or credit card information; and (b) ensure that you exit from your Account at the end of each session. Bowling eXpress LLC will not be liable for any injury, loss, or damage of any kind arising from or relating to your failure to comply with (a) and/or (b) or for any acts or omissions by you or someone else who is using your Account and/or password.</p>

						<p	class="text-justify"><b>PAYMENT AND OUR CREDIT POLICY</b></p>

						<p	class="text-justify	">Certain features of the Sites, including, without limitation, the placing of reservations, may require you to make certain payments. When paid by you, these payments are final and non-refundable, unless otherwise determined by Bowling eXpress LLC. Bowling eXpress LLC, in its sole discretion, may offer credits or refunds on a case-by-case basis including, by way of example, in the event of an error with your order or in the amounts you were charged. Also by placing a reservation through our service you understand, acknowledge and agree that any refund or money owed to you must be directed and collected from the actual Bowling Center and not Bowling eXpress LLC. and its subsidiaries and affiliates.</p>

						<p	class="text-justify	">Bowling eXpress LLC will charge, and you authorize Bowling eXpress LLC to charge, the payment method you specify at the time of purchase. If you pay any amounts with a credit card, Bowling eXpress LLC may seek pre-authorization of your credit card account prior to your purchase to verify that the credit card is valid and has credit available for your intended purchase. In the event Bowling eXpress LLC advances payment for any of your orders placed via the Sites (e.g., if you sign up for a corporate account), Bowling eXpress LLC may separately send you invoices for payment of those advanced amounts. In the event that you fail to pay such invoices within thirty (30) days of the date of such invoice (the “Payment Due Date”), you grant Bowling eXpress LLC the right, but not the obligation, to charge the credit card you provide with your Account at any time after any Payment Due Date, unless prohibited by law.</p>

						<p	class="text-justify	">Bowling eXpress LLC reserves the right to establish, remove, and/or revise prices, fees, and/or surcharges for any or all services or goods obtained through the use of the services at any time. Bowling eXpress LLC may also, in its sole discretion, make promotional offers with different features and different rates to any or all of our customers. Unless made to you, these promotional offers will have no bearing on your obligation to pay the amounts charged.</p>

						<p	class="text-justify	">We do our best to encourage civility and discourage disruptive communication on the Sites.

						<p	class="text-justify	">Additionally, bowling centers may receive messages from Bowling eXpress LLC following receipt of a completed order soliciting feedback and/or other information relating to the order.

						<p	class="text-justify	">Standard data and message rates may apply for SMS and MMS alerts, whether you send or receive such messages. Please contact your mobile phone carrier for details.
